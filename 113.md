# Frontrunning attacks by the owner

## Summary
Project has one  possible attack vectors by the `onlyOwner`:

` minFee ` variable; 
It determines the commission rate 
Can be updated by `onlyOwner` with function `setMinFee`
 

When a user use feed, expecting to have zero fee , the owner can frontrun the `fee` function and increase fees to  10000 bps , If the  size is big enough, that may be a significant amount of money.


## Vulnerability Detail

Frontrunning attacks vector of `onlyOwner` is theoretically available in all functions below because none of them have timelock but it is critical due to the risk of losing user money with `fee`.

```solidity
contracts/core/OptionsConfig.sol:
  32:     function settraderNFTContract(address value) external onlyOwner {
  37:     function setMinFee(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
  50:     function setOptionFeePerTxnLimitPercent(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  55:     function setOverallPoolUtilizationLimit(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  61:     function setAssetUtilizationLimit(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  67:     function setMaxPeriod(uint32 value) external onlyOwner {
  76:     function setMinPeriod(uint32 value) external onlyOwner {
  85:     function setMarketTime(Window[] memory windows) external onlyOwner {
```


## Impact
1 - Platform initializes  `setMinFee` function with 0 fee
2- Alice triggers the some function to use  too high from platform
3 - The transaction is theoretically monitored by the owner and `setMinFee` with the function, the fee is set to 10% by operating from the front.
3- Alice pays a serious commission when she thinks she will not pay

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a timelock to avoid instant changes of the parameters.
