# Unbounded loops may cause resolveQueuedTrades() and unlockOptions() to fail

## Summary

There are some unbounded loops that can lead to DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail

The loops inside of resolveQueuedTrades() and unlockOptions() perform multiple checks and calls, additionally. With all of this happening in the loop and costing gas it may revert due to exceeding the block size gas limit.

## Impact

The loop fails due to exceeding the block size gas limit. This will then result in a denial of service for the desired functionality and break core functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Bounding the loops, consider avoiding all the actions executed in a single transaction, especially when external calls are executed as part of a loop.
