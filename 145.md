# User funds might be locked inside the pool after they are transferred by handlers.

## Summary
User funds might be locked inside the pool after they are transferred by handlers.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `BufferBinaryPool` contract, there are handlers who can transfer between any users before the balances are unlocked.

So they don't update `liquidityPerUser[user].unlockedAmount` in `_beforeTokenTransfer()` if one side is a handler.

```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) internal override {
        if (!isHandler[from] && !isHandler[to] && from != address(0)) {
            _updateLiquidity(from);
            require(
                liquidityPerUser[from].unlockedAmount >= value,
                "Pool: Transfer of funds in lock in period is blocked"
            );
            liquidityPerUser[from].unlockedAmount -= value;
            liquidityPerUser[to].unlockedAmount += value;
        }
    }
```

After a certain time, `unlockedAmount` for each user should be the same as his balance and the below scenario would be possible.

- There are two normal users `Alice` and `Bob`. `Hans` is a handler.
- `Alice` called `provide()` with 100 amount of `tokenX` and her balance is 100. Her unlock amount is still 0.
- `Alice` tried to transfer her balance to `Bob` but it failed because her unlock amount is 0.
- So they asked `Hans` to help and managed to transfer from `Alice` to `Hans`, from `Hans` to `Bob`.
- Now `Alice`'s balance is 0 and `Bob`'s balance is 100. But their unlock amounts weren't changed in `_beforeTokenTransfer()` as one side was `Hans`.
- After the unlock time, `Bob` tries to withdraw his balance but it will revert in `_withdraw()` because his unlock amount is 0.

```solidity
    require(
        liquidityPerUser[account].unlockedAmount >= burn,
        "Pool: Withdrawal amount is greater than current unlocked amount"
    );
```

## Impact
Users wouldn't withdraw their balance forever because their unlock amount wasn't updated properly when the handlers helped the transfers.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think we should add one more field like `handlerAmount` in `ProvidedLiquidity` struct to store the transferred amounts by handlers so `unlockedAmount + handlerAmount` is the same as the balance after the unlock time.
