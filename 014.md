# Unsafe usage of ERC20 transfer and transferFrom

## Summary
Unsafe usage of ERC20 transfer and transferFrom. High Risk Finding
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens functions don’t return a boolean, for example USDT, BNB, OMG. So the BufferBinaryPool contract simply won’t work with tokens like that as the token.
## Impact
The USDT's transfer and transferFrom functions doesn't return a bool, so the call to these functions will revert although the user has enough balance and the BufferBinaryPool contract won't work, assuming that token is USDT.

## Tool used
Manual auditing - VS Code, some hardhat tests and me :)

## Recommendation
Use the OpenZepplin's safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions
