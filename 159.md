# Keepers can modify option exercise result using different asset price

## Summary
When a keeper resolves an option or unlocks an option, he gets validated data from the publisher and uses prices from it. But he can use other asset's price, and as a result, he can control if an option will be exercised or not.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    bool isSignerVerifed = _validateSigner(
        params.expiryTimestamp,
        params.asset,
        params.priceAtExpiry,
        params.signature
    );
```
When a keeper unlock an option, he gets price from data validated by the publisher. But asset is not validated here, so the keeper can use other asset's price data.

## Impact
A keeper can change price at expiry, it will affect option result. So a profitable option can be canceled, and unsuccessful option can be exercised.
