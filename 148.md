## Summary
In BufferBinaryOptions.sol and BufferBinaryPool.sol contracts, transfer `function` is used. Usage of this function is not recommended since it will fail when gas cost increased.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call() instead of transfer(), but be sure to respect the CEI pattern and/or add re-entrancy guards, as several hacks already happened in the past due to this recommendation not being fully understood.
