# Support of different ERC20 tokens

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The current version of the codebase does not handle special cases of tokens, e.g. deflationary, rebasing, or those that return true/false on success (see: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20). Function purchase transfers tokens from msg.sender but it does not check the return value, nor how many tokens were actually transferred

## Code Snippet

                       'tokenX.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), premium);'
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I have 2 suggestions here:

1. Use SafeERC20 library to handle token transfers: [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol)
2. Consider checking the actual balances transferred (balance after-before) or clearly documenting that you do not support deflationary / rebasing / etc tokens.
