# Unsafe usage of ERC20 .transfer

## Summary

Some .transfer checks in the contract are not checked for success. In other words, transfer may fail but function will still continue to work.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some .transfer functions used do not check for success.

## Impact

Fees may not be transferred correctly into and out of the protocol, resulting in protocol / user losses

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppellin's safe transfer or check the validity of every transfer such as the one used in BufferBinaryPool.sol

        bool success = tokenX.transfer(to, transferTokenXAmount);
        require(success, "Pool: The Payout transfer didn't go through");
