# If an ERC20 token that does not revert on failure in `transfer/transferFrom` is used it can result in value loss

## Summary
In multiple places in the code it makes unsafe calls to `ERC20::transfer/transferFrom` which can result in value loss for users
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)). Now if such token was used, a transfer from the protocol to the user mail fail but since the return value of the `transfer` method is not checked then the transaction will complete successfully, leaving the user without value received. One such example is in `BufferRouter` - `tokenX.transfer( queuedTrade.user, queuedTrade.totalFee - revisedFee );` - if this `fee` transfer to the user failed silently he won't be able to get that value anymore.

## Impact
It is possible that a user should receive some token amount from the protocol but it can fail silently and the user won't be able to reclaim it.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library and replace all `transfer/transferFrom` calls with `safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom`
