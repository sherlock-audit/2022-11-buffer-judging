# Token transfers do not verify that the tokens were successfully transferred

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens don’t throw but just return false when a transfer fails.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (like [zrx](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)) do not revert the transaction when the transfer/transferfrom fails and return false, which requires us to check the return value after calling the transfer/transferfrom function.

## Impact
This can be abused to trick the initiateTrade() function to initialize the trade without providing any tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20’s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom functions
