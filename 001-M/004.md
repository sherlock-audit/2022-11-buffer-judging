# Result of ERC20 transfer is ignored

## Summary
Because result of ERC20 transfer function is ignored it's possible that transfer will fail, but protocol will not notice that.
## Vulnerability Detail
BufferRouter._openQueuedTrade sends trading amount to the options contract and change to user using ERC20 transfer function and [ignore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L330-L339) boolean result from it.

Because of that it's possible that transfer will not be successful, but protocol will not notice that.
## Impact
Incorrect payments.
