# Protocol won't work with `USDT`, `BNB` and other tokens that do not return a bool on `transfer`

## Summary
Some non-standard ERC20 tokens do not return a bool on `transfer` so protocol will revert on their usage.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not return a bool (e.g. USDT, BNB, OMG) on ERC20 methods. The code in `BufferBinaryPool` checks the returned value from ERC20::transfer and ERC20::transferFrom in the following manner: 
`bool success = tokenX.transfer(to, transferTokenXAmount);`
Such checks are present on line 204, 236 and 322. All of those expect a boolean return value on `transfer` or `transferFrom` but this will always revert with the above mentioned tokens.

## Impact
Since the protocol docs say it should support **any** ERC20 token then this means protocol fails to deliver on its intentions. Also `USDT` is widely used token and it won't be supported.

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library for ERC20 transfers
