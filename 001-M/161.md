In `BufferBinaryOptions.sol`, `transfer` function is used. Some token will return the true or false representing the success or failure of transaction.
Following line of codes does not check and validate the return value.

## Impact
Though the transaction fails, it would marked as transaction done. But actually not.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the return type of transfer call and revert for false value.
I can see that similar check is done in [Line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L161-L162)
