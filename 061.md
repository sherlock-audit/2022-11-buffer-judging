# Confusing onlyRole modifier might lead to function revert

## Summary

When there is a nested function, the roles for each function changes, which might lead to function revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

In createFromRouter(),  the onlyRole(ROUTER_ROLE) modifier is required. The notice states that this function can only be called by router

     * @notice Creates an option with the specified parameters
     * @dev Can only be called by router
     */
    function createFromRouter(
        OptionParams calldata optionParams,
        bool isReferralValid
    ) external override onlyRole(ROUTER_ROLE) returns (uint256 optionID) {

However, in the function, it does a nested call to pool.lock(),

        pool.lock(optionID, option.lockedAmount, option.premium);

which has a new set of modifier, onlyRole(OPTION_ISSUER_ROLE). This function can only be called by BufferCallOptions as stated in the notice.

     * @notice Called by BufferCallOptions to lock the funds
     * @param id optionId
     * @param tokenXAmount Amount of funds that should be locked in an option
     * @param premium Premium paid to liquidity pool to lock the above funds
     */
    function lock(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 tokenXAmount,
        uint256 premium
    ) external override onlyRole(OPTION_ISSUER_ROLE) {

The function, lock(), is external. This means that the OPTION_ISSUER_ROLE can call it. However, the function aforementioned, createFromRouter(), is unable to call this lock() function.

## Impact

Funds cannot be locked and options cannot start.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure that the roles are aligned. Also, I think that the protocol is referring to BufferBinaryOptions instead of BufferCallOptions (which does not exist as a contract)
