# [NAZ-M2] `maxLiquidity` Can Be Set Wrong & Doesn't Multiply By `10**_tokenX.decimals()`

## Summary
`setMaxLiquidity()` is Used for adjusting the max limit of the pool. However, it is missing some checks and decimal multiplication.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently for `maxLiquidity` it doesn't check if it's greater than the current `totalTokenXBalance` and it doesn't multiply the input parameter `_maxLiquidity`By `10**_tokenX.decimals()`.

## Impact
These missing checks can cause unwanted issues for the protocol such as not allowing users to provide `tokenX` to the pool.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the additional validation check and do the multiplication on the input parameter `_maxLiquidity`.
