# BufferBinaryOptions#supportsInterface is implemented incorrectly and won't return compatible with ERC721

## Summary

BufferBinaryOptions#supportsInterface is implemented incorrectly and won't return compatible with ERC721. It overrides both ERC721 and AccessControl. The problem in this case it that it only calls super.supportsInterface, which means it only follows the super chain down AccessControl and not down ERC721. Without comparing against ERC721 interfaceIds it will incorrectly return that it doesn't support the ERC721 standard

## Vulnerability Detail

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        override(ERC721, AccessControl)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }

BufferBinaryOptions#supportsInterface overrides ERC721#supportsInterface and AccessControl#supportsInterface. Super triggers the AccessControl chain of interfaceIds which only compares it against AccessControl and ERC165. This leaves out all the ERC721 interfaceIds.

## Impact

Contract incorrectly returns that it isn't compatible with ERC721 interfaceIds

## Recommendation

Function should call both, to make sure both branches are accounted for:

        function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
            public
            view
            override(ERC721, AccessControl)
            returns (bool)
        {
    -       return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    +       return (ERC721.supportsInterface(interfaceId) || AccessControl.supportsInterface(interfaceId));
        }
