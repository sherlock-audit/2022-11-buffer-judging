# steal pool profit by timing the `unlock` transaction

## Summary

The mint and withdraw amount is based on `totalSupply()` and `totalTokenXBalance()`, which based on tokenX balance and `lockedPremium`. But if the pool makes a profit with OTM option, the `lockedPremium` will be unlocked immediately, changing the mint and withdraw denominator, so the exchange rate for mint and withdraw will change accordingly. A malicious user can abuse this by timing the keeper's transaction for pool profits. The `lockupPeriod` can be circumvented by using 2 different wallets. 

As a result, some portion of the pool profits will be stolen.



## Vulnerability Detail


Assuming now a USDC pool has totalSupply of 2000, USDC balance of 400, `lockedPremium` is 200. `totalTokenXBalance()` should be 200.
A malicious user can do the following:

1. prepare 2 wallets A and B, using wallet A to `provide()` 200 USDC first, now the pool has totalSupply of 4000, USDC balance of 600, `lockedPremium` 200, `totalTokenXBalance()` should be 400. Waiting until 10 mins `lockupPeriod` passed, nothing happens during this period.
2. watch the mempool, a keeper send tx to `unlock()` some option with profit of 100 USDC (OTM), the locked premium of 100 USDC should be unlocked.
3. the malicious user will front run the tx from the keeper, `provide()` 200 USDC with wallet B before the locked premium is unlocked. Wallet B should have pool supply of 2000. The pool now has totalSupply of 6000, USDC balance of 800, `lockedPremium` 200, `totalTokenXBalance()` 600.
4. keeper's tx executed. The pool now has totalSupply of 6000, USDC balance of 800, `lockedPremium` 100, `totalTokenXBalance()` 700.
5. the user will use wallet A to call `withdraw()` right after keeper's tx. The pool now has totalSupply of 4000, USDC balance of 567.67, `lockedPremium` 100, `totalTokenXBalance()` 467.67.

In this example, the user uses 2 wallets, sandwiched the keeper's tx, `provide()` 200 USDC with wallet B, `withdraw()` 233.33 USDC with wallet A, total profit 33.33 USDC. 

With 2 wallets the `lockupPeriod` can be circumvented. After 10 mins, wallet B will be ready to withdraw, it could be done over and over by utilizing 2 different wallets. And pool will lose some portion of the profits from premiums.


## Impact

The pool will lose some portion of the profits from premiums.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider add some time delay in `withdraw()`. Calculate the withdraw amount not based on the spot balance, but after some time window.
