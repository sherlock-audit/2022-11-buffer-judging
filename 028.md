# Length of lockedliquidity[msg.sender].length is calculated incorrectly for users

## Summary

The function lock(x,y,z) in BufferBinaryPool does not correctly check the length of lockedLiquidity. This results in function revert which leads to router being unable to create options.

## Vulnerability Detail

In lock(), there is a requirement whereby id == lockedLiquidity[msg.sender].length

        require(id == lockedLiquidity[msg.sender].length, "Pool: Wrong id");

This id is obtained from BufferBinaryOptions.sol [createFromRouter()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryOptions.sol#L123-L142). The id will always be ever-increasing because of _generateTokenId(). 

    function _generateTokenId() internal returns (uint256) {
        return nextTokenId++;
    }

If the Id reaches 10 and a user wants to create an option, his lockedLiquidity[user] will be 0 because he has not created an option yet. However, since the id is 10, and the length is 0, lock will always fail, resulting in function revert.

## Impact

User cannot create any options.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a separate mapping to log all accounts from all users so that protocol can keep track of the option id and the option struct at the same time, similar to BufferRouter.sol
