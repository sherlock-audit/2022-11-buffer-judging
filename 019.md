# No helper function to change  lockedPeriod in future.

## Summary
There is no helper function to change the current `lockedPeriod` of `10 minutes` to another value in the future.
## Vulnerability Detail
No way to change locked Period in future. As the variable is not defined as constant, the admin must be wanting to change it in the future.
## Impact
Restraining the protocol 's ability to change the locked Time is a handicap.
