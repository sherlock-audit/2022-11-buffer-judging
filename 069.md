# The creation window for forex options is inconsistent with common sense

## Summary
Since forex market is running 24 hours a day without interruption, it has two choices to make creation window for forex options,  inconsistent with the method in function `BufferBinaryOptions.isInCreationWindow`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`BufferBinaryOptions.isInCreationWindow` is the function only for forex options. Since Buffer offers fast-paced trading of short-expiry options (<24 hrs), there are two choices in its implementation of creation window.
1. Let the start time and end time of forex options begin and finish with fixed time point of standard time, like UTC+0, UTC+24.
2. More reasonable, let the start time be the time the option proposed using `block.timestamp`, and the end be the time less or equal to `block.timestamp + 24 hours`.

However, in `BufferBinaryOptions.isInCreationWindow` implementation, the start time and end time is configured by owner setting, which is inconsistent with the above two choices.

## Impact
The creation window for forex options is inconsistent with common sense.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Let the start and end time be the fixed time point of standard time, without owner setting. Or more reasonable, let the start time be the time the option proposed using `block.timestamp`, and the end be the time less or equal to `block.timestamp + 24 hours`.
