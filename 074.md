# Internal accounting may become corrupted

## Summary

Buffer contest states 'any ERC20 supported', therefore it should consider taking into account tokens that takes (or may take) fees on transfer, like for example the Tether USD (see [USDT Token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L1)) or some deflationary tokens, to avoid the risk of breaking internal accounting of the Buffer contracts.

While probably this can be addressed at a later time and temporarily mitigated by ensuring no such contract is whitelisted, I'm rising this issue as High due to the impact type (financial loss, interruption of service).

## Vulnerability Detail

Some deflationary tokens or tokens like the Tether USD token (see [USDT Token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L1)) can apply a fee to transfers.

***USDT Token snippet (no return value) from Etherscan***
```solidity
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(3 * 32) {
	var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];

	// Check is not needed because sub(_allowance, _value) will already throw if this condition is not met
	// if (_value > _allowance) throw;

	uint fee = (_value.mul(basisPointsRate)).div(10000);
	if (fee > maximumFee) {
		fee = maximumFee;
	}
	if (_allowance < MAX_UINT) {
		allowed[_from][msg.sender] = _allowance.sub(_value);
	}
	uint sendAmount = _value.sub(fee);
	balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_value);
	balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(sendAmount);
	if (fee > 0) {
		balances[owner] = balances[owner].add(fee);
		Transfer(_from, owner, fee);
	}
	Transfer(_from, _to, sendAmount);
}
```

As a result, the transfer of some amount may result in the recipient of the transfer to receiver a smaller amount, by a fee.

Contracts that integrate with this type of tokens should take into consideration such type of behaviour to ensure internal accounting is consistent with the behaviour.

## Impact

Given a token that apply a transfer fee, some of the transfers from the trader (or external accounts/contracts) to the Buffer contracts, or between the Buffer contracts, will result in the recipient of the transfer to receive a smaller amount than specified. The amount logged by the Buffer internal accounting will be higher than the actual amount, which may result in unexpected behaviours, financial loss, and interruption of service.

One such example:
- a certain ERC20 token applies a 10% fee on transfers;
- a trader [initiates a new trade](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L62) of the above token with a [totalFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L98) of 100;
- the [transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L86-L90) results in the amount of 90 being transferred to the [BufferRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol) contract;
- the newly queued trade is created with the variable [totalFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L98) which is 100 rather than 90;
- the trader change his mind and [cancels the trade](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L121) causing the [BufferRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol) contract to transfer the [totalFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L98) amount back to the user effectively paying for the fees (Buffer contract received in 90 but the transferred out 100).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Where accounting would be impacted by such type of tokens, the accounting should be updated accounting for the difference of the post and pre transfer balances, as follows:

1. Check the pre-transfer balance
2. Executing the actual transfer
3. Check the post-transfer balance
4. Account for the difference between the two balances
