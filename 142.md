# Withdraw can reverts and locks funds

## Summary
Withdraw method reverts in some cases.

First for ERC20 tokens with fee on transfer will revert locking the function and within funds.

Also, on several locations in the code precautions are being taken to not divide by `0`, this should be done as a division by `0` would revert the code.

## Vulnerability Detail
Navigate to the following contracts,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L291

- `divCeil` is called in `_withdraw` method, this in fact, can make `_withdraw` to revert because of 0 division after getting balance from `totalTokenXBalance`.

- As `totalTokenXBalance` is called in withdraw, exists the case of ERC20 tokens with fee on transfer will reverts on withdraws as: 
lockedPremium > tokenX.balanceOf(address(this))
will cause an underflow.

Also, following the line of divisions by 0, totalTokenXBalance can be 0 in 2 cases 

Case 1
tokenX.balanceOf(address(this)) = arbitraryValue;
lockedPremium = arbitraryValue;

Case 2
tokenX.balanceOf(address(this)) = 0;

    function totalTokenXBalance()
        public
        view
        override
        returns (uint256 balance)
    {
        return tokenX.balanceOf(address(this)) - lockedPremium;
    }

There is one case that I find within my revision the code for one of this cases to occur:

    function lock(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 tokenXAmount,
        uint256 premium
    ) external override onlyRole(OPTION_ISSUER_ROLE) {
        require(id == lockedLiquidity[msg.sender].length, "Pool: Wrong id");

        require(
            (lockedAmount + tokenXAmount) <= totalTokenXBalance(),
            "Pool: Amount is too large."
        );

        bool success = tokenX.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), premium);
        require(success, "Pool: The Premium transfer didn't go through");

        lockedLiquidity[msg.sender].push(
            LockedLiquidity(tokenXAmount, premium, true)
        );
        lockedPremium = lockedPremium + premium;
        lockedAmount = lockedAmount + tokenXAmount;
    }

As mentioned in another issue, there are ERC20 tokens that have fee on transfer, this means that
- premium and lockedPremium can be more than tokenX balance, this would cause an underflow in the 
        `return tokenX.balanceOf(address(this)) - lockedPremium;`
        and revert since pragma version >= 0.8.0


## Impact

## Code Snippet
- divCeil lines that reverts on balance 0
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L416
        uint256 c = a / b;

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L417
        if (a % b != 0) c = c + 1;

- Also in can fail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L372
        return (amount * balance) / totalSupply;
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
- Recommend making sure division by `0` wonâ€™t occur by checking the variables beforehand and handling this edge case.
