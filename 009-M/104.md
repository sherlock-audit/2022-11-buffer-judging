# Unbounded loop

## Summary
```_getUnlockedLiquidity``` can stuck if too many ```lockedAmounts``` needs to be processed.

## Vulnerability Detail
When unlocking the liquidity it iterates from ```nextIndexForUnlock``` to the end:
```solidity
    function _getUnlockedLiquidity(address account)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 unlockedAmount, uint256 nextIndexForUnlock)
    {
        uint256 len = liquidityPerUser[account].lockedAmounts.length;
        unlockedAmount = liquidityPerUser[account].unlockedAmount;
        uint256 index = liquidityPerUser[account].nextIndexForUnlock;
        nextIndexForUnlock = index;
        for (uint256 n = index; n < len; n++) {
            if (
                liquidityPerUser[account].lockedAmounts[n].timestamp +
                    lockupPeriod <=
                block.timestamp
            ) {
                unlockedAmount += liquidityPerUser[account]
                    .lockedAmounts[n]
                    .amount;
                nextIndexForUnlock = n + 1;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
```
Unbounded loops are dangerous because if there are too many iterations that could not fit in one single block, the whole execution will revert. This could happen if, for example, the user provides liquidity many times in short intervals and comes back later when all this liquidity can be unlocked. It would try to loop over all the entries but the block gas limit was not enough to reach the end.

## Impact
This scenario while unlikely is possible, thus the protocol should be robust enough to handle such cases. The likelihood is low but the impact would be huge: stuck users won't be able to unlock their liquidity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider introducing a max limit for the ```lockedAmounts.length``` - ```nextIndexForUnlock```. Measure how many many active locks the user can have that do not revert when all of them are unlocked at the same time.
