# Very critical `Owner` privileges can cause complete destruction of the project in a possible privateKey exploit

## Summary
Typically, the contract’s owner is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the owner is able to perform certain privileged activities.

However, Owner privileges are numerous and there is no timelock structure in the process of using these privileges.
The Owner is assumed to be an EOA, since the documents do not provide information on whether the Owner will be a multisign structure.


## Vulnerability Detail
`onlyOwner` powers;

```solidity
contracts/core/OptionsConfig.sol:
  32:     function settraderNFTContract(address value) external onlyOwner {
  37:     function setMinFee(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
  50:     function setOptionFeePerTxnLimitPercent(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  55:     function setOverallPoolUtilizationLimit(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  61:     function setAssetUtilizationLimit(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  67:     function setMaxPeriod(uint32 value) external onlyOwner {
  76:     function setMinPeriod(uint32 value) external onlyOwner {
  85:     function setMarketTime(Window[] memory windows) external onlyOwner {
```

## Impact
In parallel with the private key thefts of the project owners, which have increased recently, this vulnerability has been stated as medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1- A timelock contract should be added to use `onlyOwner` privileges. In this way, users can be warned in case of a possible security weakness.

2- `onlyOwner` can be a Multisign wallet and this part is specified in the documentation
