# Emitted amount can be bigger than expected

## Summary
Emitted amount can be bigger than expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
It's the same issue mentioned before but cases where is less harmful, as it doesn't affect the protocol itself. However, some external applications won't work as expected

There are ERC20 tokens with transfer at fees. For checking if the transferred amount is the same as expected, code already compares balanceOf before and balanceOf after transfer. People can get confused in cases where real value doesn't match
## Impact
Users confuse + applications that uses this offchain data won't work right, for example subgraphs

        tokenX.transfer(config.settlementFeeDisbursalContract(), settlementFee);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a system like:

        uint256 balanceBefore = _token.balanceOf(address(this));
        _token.safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
        uint256 balanceAfter = _token.balanceOf(address(this));

        // whatever check / control flow when (balanceAfter - balanceBefore != _amount);
