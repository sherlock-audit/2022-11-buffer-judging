# block.timestamp used as time proxy

## Summary
Risk of using `block.timestamp` for time should be considered. 
## Vulnerability Detail
SWC ID: 116

## Impact
`block.timestamp` is not an ideal proxy for time because of issues with synchronization, miner manipulation and changing block times. 

This kind of issue may affect the code allowing or reverting the code before the expected deadline, modifying the normal functioning or reverting sometimes.
## Code Snippet
- used for comparissons

            if (block.timestamp - queuedTrade.queuedTime <= MAX_WAIT_TIME) {

        require(option.expiration <= block.timestamp, "O4");

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider the risk of using `block.timestamp` as time proxy and evaluate if block numbers can be used as an approximation for the application logic. Both have risks that need to be factored in. 
- Consider using an oracle for precision
