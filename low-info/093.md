# Pointless variables

## Summary
There are variables that are either not used or are meaningless.

## Vulnerability Detail
```ReferralStorage``` has variables that are never set nor read:
```solidity
  mapping(uint8 => Tier) public tiers;
  mapping(address => ReferralData) public UserReferralData;
```
```BufferRouter``` has ```nextQueueIdToProcess``` and ```userNextQueueIndexToProcess``` which are set when resolving queued trades:
```solidity
  // Track the next queueIndex to be processed for user
  userNextQueueIndexToProcess[queuedTrade.user] =
      queuedTrade.userQueueIndex +
      1;
```
```solidity
  // Track the next queueIndex to be processed overall
  nextQueueIdToProcess = params[params.length - 1].queueId + 1;
```
It just sets these indexed to the last parameter's queue id.
However, the resolve function does not require that the queued trades are in order or that there are no gaps. This means that the aforementioned variables do not actually represent the next index, it works only if the keeper is always careful and coherent which I assume will not be the case in practice.

## Impact
Such variables are confusing for the reader and consumer. Also could trick the keeper to skip some trades.
I submitted this as low because currently this cannot be used to exploit the system and gain any value.

## Recommendation
Consider either removing these variables or improving the usage of them.
