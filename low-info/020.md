# lockedPeriod check can be bypassed in certain case.

## Summary
The `_getUnlockedLiquidity` function in [BufferBinary](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol) contract checks whether the locked funds are unlocked or not . 
It relies on the current `block.timestamp`  and the [`lockedPeriod`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L23)  . 
And lockedPeriod can be changed in the future.(Refer to my previous vulnerability report #2 )
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a scenario where  , current `lockedPeriod` = 10 minutes and I entered in a position at 11 AM . And side by side , admin decides to change the `lockedPeriod ` value from 10 minutes to 30 minutes. Now , if the user tries to get out of the position for another 20 minutes , he will not be able to do so , as the value is changed and `_getUnlockedLiquidity` function reads the  `lockedPeriod` value directly as an SLOAD. Hence any change to it , will impact users with active positions.

Options is a volatile market, every minute matters , this will have a severe impact , every time the lockedPeriod is changed. 

Preventing this via a timelock in changing the lockedPeriod function will not do much help , as there is no restriction for users to enter a new position at the last minute , when the `lockedPeriod` value will be changed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cache the lockedPeriod in the [ProvidedLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/interfaces/Interfaces.sol#L198) struct and use it instead of calling the SLOAD directly, thereby preventing damage to users in case of change in lockedPeriod.
