# There is a risk that the `minFee` variable is accidentally initialized to 0 and platform loses money

## Summary

With the `setMinFee()` in the `OptionsConfig.sol` file, the initial rate of `fee` is set with an argument of type uint256, but there is no check that prevents this rate 0.
There is a risk that the Fee variable is accidentally initialized to 0



## Vulnerability Detail
Fee with 0 is an administrative decision, but since there is no information about this in the documentation and NatSpec comments during the audit, we can assume that it will not be 0

In addition, it is a strong belief that it will not be 0, as it is an issue that will affect the platform revenues.

Although the value initialized with 0 by mistake or forgetting can be changed later by onlyOwner, in the first place it can be exploited by users and cause huge amount  usage


## Impact

```solidity
contracts/core/OptionsConfig.sol:
  36  
  37:     function setMinFee(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
  38:         minFee = value;
  39:         emit UpdateMinFee(value);
  40:     }
```
