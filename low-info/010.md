# Fee can be changed after trade was initiated

## Summary
It's possible that between initiating a trade and creation option the fee will be changed by protocol. As result created trade with one fee can be executed with another fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
BufferBinaryOptions.configure allows admin to [change fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryOptions.sol#L66-L82).
When user decides to initiate trade then he is supposing to pay fee at the moment of trade initiating.
But it's possible that during initiation trade and creating option by keeper the fee will be changed by admin. As result if fee was increased, user will get less reward then he expects in case of win. 
## Impact
User will pay more fees, however he expected to pay less.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
User can provide new variable like `maxFeeAgreed` to `initiateTrade` function where he provides the expected fee amount and in case if this fee is bigger [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferRouter.sol#L315) then the trade should be canceled.
