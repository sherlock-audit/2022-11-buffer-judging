# If the renounceOwnership authorization is used, the project becomes unavailable

## Summary
`onlyOwner` has another secret import (from Ownable.sol) privilege: `renounceOwnership()`
They can use this authority whenever he wants, there is no restriction.
If he uses this authority, the very important functions detailed below will not be available, updated


## Vulnerability Detail
We see the use of Openzeppelin in `Ownable.sol` in many contracts and owners can `renounceOwnership()` like this project, which is sometimes a positive as it reduces the risk of rugpull but the situation is a bit different here, Owner is constantly needed
(For example settraderNFTContract  / setMinFee) , so security risk is high

```solidity
contracts/core/OptionsConfig.sol:
  32:     function settraderNFTContract(address value) external onlyOwner {
  37:     function setMinFee(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
  50:     function setOptionFeePerTxnLimitPercent(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  55:     function setOverallPoolUtilizationLimit(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  61:     function setAssetUtilizationLimit(uint16 value) external onlyOwner {
  67:     function setMaxPeriod(uint32 value) external onlyOwner {
  76:     function setMinPeriod(uint32 value) external onlyOwner {
  85:     function setMarketTime(Window[] memory windows) external onlyOwner {
```

## Impact

1 - OnlyOwner does renounceOwnership() based on her authority in the Ownable.sol contract
2 - The project required updating `settraderNFTContract`
3 - Unfortunately this cannot be done

```solidity
    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(address(0));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of directly importing the Ownable.sol contract, a project-specific `Ownable.sol` should be used by removing the `renounceOwnership()` function, which is the subject of the above-mentioned potential problem.
