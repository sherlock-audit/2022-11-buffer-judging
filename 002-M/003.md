## Summary

When protocol transfers funds from user to contract, it doesn't check the amount they received using ERC20 balance function. If fee on transfer tokens are used that means that protocol will not be able to make funds calculations correctly.

For example if user initiated trading and then canceled it, the protocol will lose some amount.
## Impact
Lose of funds for protocol.
