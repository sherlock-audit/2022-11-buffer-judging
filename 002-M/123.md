# Not compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
Not compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
There are ERC20 tokens that charge fee for every transfer() or transferFrom(). When using fee-on-transfer tokens in contracts, there are some unexpected situations.
For example, in BufferRouter.initiateTrade, the number of tokens received by the contract will be less than totalFee,
Malicious users can drain the tokens in the contract by constantly creating and canceling trades
## Impact
Malicious users can drain the tokens in the contract by constantly creating and canceling trades

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider getting the received amount by calculating the difference of token balance (using balanceOf) before and after the transferFrom.
