# Possible cross chain replay attacks when attempting to validate signer

## Summary
The `_validateSigner()` function is used when calling `resolveQueuedTrades()` and `unlockOptions()` however, the chain id is not specified when attempting to validate the signature. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no chain id in the signed data. 

## Impact
If a user calls a function which uses the `_validateSigner()` function while using the incorrect network, the attacker can replay the act on the correct chain to cause unexpected results.

## Tool used

## Recommendation
Consider including `block.chainId` in the hashed content.
