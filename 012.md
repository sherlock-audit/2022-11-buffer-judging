# Share price manipulation is possible for first depositor of BufferBinaryPool

## Summary
Share price manipulation is possible for first depositor of BufferBinaryPool. As a result next depositors can lost part of their funds, while attacker will get more.
## Vulnerability Detail
BufferBinaryPool is created.
Alice buys first share for 1 wei using `BufferBinaryPool.provide` function. Price of 1 share becomes 1 wei.
Then Alice donates a big amount `aliceAmount` of assets to BufferBinaryPool directly(simple ERC20 transfer). Now we have `1 wei` amount of shares and `aliceAmount + 1` of deposited assets controlled by BufferBinaryPool.

Then Bob deposits arbitrary amount of assets, that is `bobAmount > aliceAmount`.
As result Bob receives `bobAmount / (aliceAmount + 1)` shares because of rounding here. Bob loses part of `bobAmount % aliceAmount` sent to the vault, alice controls more assets in vault now.
## Impact
Next depositors can lost their money, while first user will take all of them or some part.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add limit for the first deposit to be a big amount to mint big amount of shares on start.
