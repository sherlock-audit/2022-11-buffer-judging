# Return value of transfers not checked consistently

## Summary

The return value of transfer calls is not asserted consistently. This can potentially cause silent fails and users will be able to queue trades without depositing.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BufferBinaryPool` asserts that `transferFrom` calls have returned true and hence were successful:

```js
bool success = tokenX.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), premium);
require(success, "Pool: The Premium transfer didn't go through");
```

The `BufferRouter` does not perform this check:

```js
IERC20(optionsContract.tokenX()).transferFrom(
    msg.sender,
    address(this),
    totalFee
);
```

If `tokenX` were to use an implementation that does not throw and just return `false` on failure (e.g. if the approval is too low), this could cause a user to call `initiateTrade` without actually paying fees.

## Impact

If a user manages to initiate a trade without paying the fees, the tokens that are sent during `_openQueuedTrade` would be taken from another user, effectively stealing from them. Also the latter would not be able to resolve his own trades, due to a lack of `tokenX` balance in the router.

## Recommendation

Consistently assert that the return value of transfers is `true`.
