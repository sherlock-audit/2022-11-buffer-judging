# Use `safeMint` as opposed to `mint` for options

## Summary
`BufferBinaryOptions` inherits from ERC721 but it uses `_mint` instead of `_safeMint`, which can result in stuck tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `createFromRouter` method in `BufferBinaryOptions` the code calls `_mint` to mint the ERC721 token to the `optionParams.user`. The problem is that if the account that is `optionParams.user` was a smart contract that does not handle ERC721 tokens, then this newly minted option token will be stuck.

## Impact
This problem can result in a newly minted option stuck forever, without a way to exercise it.

## Recommendation
Use the `_safeMint` method instead of `_mint`
