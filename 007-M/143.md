# _safeMint() should be used rather than _mint() wherever possible

## Summary
`_mint()` is discouraged in favor of `_safeMint()` which ensures that the recipient is either an EOA or implements IERC721Receiver. 

Both open OpenZeppelin and solmate have versions of this function so that NFTs aren’t lost if they’re minted to contracts that cannot transfer them back out.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `BufferBinaryOptions.sol` and `BufferBinaryPool.sol`, eventually it is called ERC721 `_mint()`. Calling `_mint()` this way does not ensure that the receiver of the NFT is able to accept them, making possible to lose them. 

`_safeMint()` should be used with as it checks to see if a user can properly accept an NFT and reverts otherwise.

There is no check of the address provided by the mint NFT that it implements ERC721Receiver. 
## Impact
Tokens can get lost
## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryOptions.sol#L126
        _mint(optionParams.user, optionID);

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L243
        _mint(account, mint);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_safeMint()` as suggested by OpenZeppelin or include the check before minting.
