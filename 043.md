# Lock function unable to execute

## Summary
Lock function unable to execute due to inconsistent initializaiton of id and lockedLiquidity values. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In respect of below code: 

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L154> 

In the lock function, the id is set to start from 1, given: 

- id (optionId) in BufferBinaryPool.sol is set as _generateTokenId() in BufferBinaryOptions.sol 
- Function _generateTokenId() returns nextTokenId++ 
- nextTokenId is initialzed as 0

 However, lockedLiquidity[msg.sender].length is set to start from 0. 

Hence, (!id == lockedLiquidity[msg.sender].length) and the lock function will not be able to execute. 

## Impact
Lock function unable to execute

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure consistent values for id and lockedLiquidity values at inital stage. 
lockedLiquidity value should be first filled before running require check as shown above.
