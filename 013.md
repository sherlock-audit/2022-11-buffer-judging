# No check on transferFrom() return value

## Summary
In Router contract, funds are at risk, an attacker can initiate the trades without paying any fee and then cancel those trades. Attacker cancel the one of his open trade, by calling `cancelQueuedTrade(uint256 queueId)` on router contract, it will then call `_cancelQueuedTrade(uint256 queueId)` and transferred the tokensX back to the attacker which was never received from him before (as a fee while opening a trade).

## Vulnerability Detail

In BufferRouter contract, `initiateTrade()` is a function to open a trade. Whenever user open a new trade, smart contract collects the fees from the user for opening his trade. 

As there is no check on return value of transferFrom, so even though the transfer of tokens(as a fee) failed , it won't revert and adds the user's request to the trade queue.

## Impact
The transferFrom function will failed silently, with which user can 
 - leverage the trading without paying any fee.
 - received as many tokenX from the contract.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
IERC20(optionsContract.tokenX()).transferFrom(
          msg.sender,
          address(this),
          totalFee
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the call into a require() or use openzeppelin's [SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) library.
