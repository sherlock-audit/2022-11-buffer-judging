# `BufferRouter.sol` and `BufferBinaryPool.sol` doesn't support ERC20 Tokens with fee on transfer

## Summary
`BufferRouter.sol` and `BufferBinaryPool.sol` doesn't support ERC20 Tokens with fee on transfer
## Vulnerability Detail
There are ERC20 tokens that charge fee for every `transfer()` / `transferFrom()`.

In `BufferRouter.sol` and `BufferBinaryPool.sol` it is being assumed in functions where `transfer()` / `transferFrom()` that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount, and uses it to calculate locked funds, balance amounts, etc. While the actual transferred amount can be lower for those tokens.

## Code Snippet

        tokenX.transfer(queuedTrade.targetContract, revisedFee);

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L204
        bool success = tokenX.transfer(to, transferTokenXAmount);

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L161-L169
        bool success = tokenX.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), premium);

## Recommendation
Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
