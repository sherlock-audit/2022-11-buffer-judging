# User funds might be at risk by malicious handlers.

## Summary
User funds might be at risk by malicious handlers.

## Vulnerability Detail
Handlers can transfer funds between any users using `transferFrom()`.

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address _sender,
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _amount
    ) public virtual override returns (bool) {
        if (isHandler[msg.sender]) {
            _transfer(_sender, _recipient, _amount);
            return true;
        }

        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(_sender, msg.sender);
        require(
            currentAllowance >= _amount,
            "Pool: transfer amount exceeds allowance"
        );
        unchecked {
            _approve(_sender, msg.sender, currentAllowance - _amount);
        }
        _transfer(_sender, _recipient, _amount);
        return true;
    }
```

So if a user has positive balances and a malicious handler can transfer his balance to any non-handler account(controlled by him) right after the unlock time.

After that, it can be withdrawn from the non-handler account.

Normally, it's not recommended to transfer funds from any users without their allowance.

## Impact
Malicious handlers might steal the balance of normal users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think the handers are introduced to transfer funds between users before the unlock time.

Even though they can transfer before the unlock time, the sender's allowance should be checked for safety in `transferFrom()`.
