# _withdraw() check the wrong variable

## Summary
in BufferBinaryPool#_withdraw() 
The real amount of transfers is "tokenXAmountToWithdraw", so we should use this variable to check if we have enough balance. But now we use "tokenXAmount"

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 tokenXAmount, address account)
        internal
        returns (uint256 burn)
    {
        require(
            tokenXAmount <= availableBalance(),
            "Pool: Not enough funds on the pool contract. Please lower the amount."
        );//**audit check tokenXAmount ***/
...

        uint256 tokenXAmountToWithdraw = maxUserTokenXWithdrawal < tokenXAmount
            ? maxUserTokenXWithdrawal
            : tokenXAmount;
...

        bool success = tokenX.transfer(account, tokenXAmountToWithdraw); //***audit but use tokenXAmountToWithdraw to transer ****/
        require(success, "Pool: The Withdrawal didn't go through");

```

## Recommendation

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 tokenXAmount, address account)
        internal
        returns (uint256 burn)
    {
-       require(
-            tokenXAmount <= availableBalance(),
-            "Pool: Not enough funds on the pool contract. Please lower the amount."
-       );
        uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint256 balance = totalTokenXBalance();
...
        uint256 tokenXAmountToWithdraw = maxUserTokenXWithdrawal < tokenXAmount
            ? maxUserTokenXWithdrawal
            : tokenXAmount;

+       require(
+           tokenXAmountToWithdraw <= availableBalance(),
+             "Pool: Not enough funds on the pool contract. Please lower the amount."
+        );
