# Use SafeERC20 for transfers

## Summary
Some `transfer` and `transferFrom` are called and required to return `true` on successful transaction. However, not all ERC20 tokens return a boolean.

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on this [discord message](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1041727871414173776/1042804728184189038) contract is made to handle all tokens. However [missing return value](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca) would make that impossible cause there are cases such as [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L161-L162) where `require` statement would always be false.

## Impact
* Some tokens would be unusable. 
* Losing funds is hypothetically possible.

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20 for IERC20. safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom would always return true for successful transactions
