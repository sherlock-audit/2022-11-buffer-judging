# setCodeOwner can be called by anyone to change someone else's referral code to them

## Summary
`setCodeOwner` lacks an onlyOwner modifier and hence anyone can just claim someone else's referral code as theirs. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`setCodeOwner` allows an existing referral code to be set to another owner. However, it lacks an onlyOwner modifier and hence anyone can just claim someone else's referral code as theirs. 

```solidity
    function setCodeOwner(string memory _code, address _newUser) external {
        require(bytes(_code).length != 0, "ReferralStorage: invalid _code");

        require(msg.sender == codeOwner[_code], "ReferralStorage: forbidden");

        codeOwner[_code] = _newUser;
        emit SetCodeOwner(msg.sender, _newUser, _code);
    }
```
## Impact
User can change someone else's referral code to themselves, allowing the rewards to go to them instead of the original owner of the referral code.
