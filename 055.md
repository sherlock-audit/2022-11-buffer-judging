# The keepers/routers' gas can be intentionally and continuously consumed

## Summary
The contract do not check the status of referrers' address when transferring to it. Then, for example, a referrer can intentionally depoly a contract to let transferring succeed only once every five times in its fallback function, to continuously consume the keepers/routers' gas. And more seriously, it reverts the operation of resolving queued trades.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The users call `BufferRouter.initiateTrade` to open a trader;
2. The keeper listens to these requests and calls `BufferRouter.resolveQueuedTrades`;
3. The critical call path of `BufferRouter.resolveQueuedTrades` is `BufferRouter.resolveQueuedTrades` -> `BufferRouter._openQueuedTrade` -> `BufferBinaryOptions.createFromRouter` -> `BufferBinaryOptions->_processReferralRebate` -> `tokenX.transfer(referrer, referrerFee)`;
4. The malicious referrer could depoly a contract with fallback function payable, and, i.e.,  let `tokenX.transfer` succeed only once every five times.

## Impact
The keepers/routers' gas can be intentionally and continuously consumed. And more seriously, a malicious referrer can revert the operation of resolving queued trades.

## Code Snippet
`BufferRouter.resolveQueuedTrades` -> `BufferRouter._openQueuedTrade` -> `BufferBinaryOptions.createFromRouter` -> `BufferBinaryOptions->_processReferralRebate` -> `tokenX.transfer(referrer, referrerFee)`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the status of referrers' address, like
`require(referrer.code.length==0, "unsafe_recipient")`
