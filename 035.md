# ECDSA signature malleability

## Summary
The codebase uses openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2 package which has ECDSA signature malleability for the functions that take a single bytes argument.
## Vulnerability Detail
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature via `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format.

A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection.

## Impact
The functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single bytes argument, and not the functions that take r, v, s or r, vs as separate arguments.

The potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _validateSigner(
        uint256 timestamp,
        address asset,
        uint256 price,
        bytes memory signature
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 digest = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(timestamp, asset, price))
        );
        address recoveredSigner = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
        return recoveredSigner == publisher;
    }
```
