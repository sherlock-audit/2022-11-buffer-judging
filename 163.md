# The period for forex options can be larger unexpectedly

## Summary
When a pending order is opened by a keeper, the option parameters are validated in `BufferBinaryOptions.checkParams`.
At first, if the option type is forex, it validates the period using `BufferBinaryOptions.isInCreationWindow`. But there is a bug in `isInCreationWindow`.
So the period can be larger than it should be.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        uint256 currentDay = ((currentTime / 86400) + 4) % 7;
        uint256 expirationDay = (((currentTime + period) / 86400) + 4) % 7;

        if (currentDay == expirationDay) {  // @audit - checked only days of the week
```

In `isInCreationWindow`, it gets the days of week of the current day and the expired day respectively, and checks if they are the same.
But the forex trading is handled on Intraday, and the current time and expire time (current time + period) should be on same day.
The check using days of week is valid only the period is smaller than 7 days. Actually the period is validated from `config.maxPeriod()`, and the default value of `config.maxPeriod()` is 1 day. But when the admin set this `maxPeriod`, it checks only the lower bound. 
```solidity
    function setMaxPeriod(uint32 value) external onlyOwner {
        require(
            value >= 1 minutes,
            "MaxPeriod needs to be greater than 1 minutes"
        );
```
So technically the `maxPeriod` can be any value. If `maxPeriod` and `period` is 7 days, current time and expire time are not in the same day, but the days of the weeks are the same, and the if statement will be passed. 

## Impact
The period for forex options can be larger than 1 day.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if current day and expire day are the same exactly.
Add upper bound validation to `OptionsConfig.setMaxPeriod`.
