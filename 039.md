# `registerCode` function is frontrunnable and it can be abused

## Summary
`registerCode` function is frontrunnable and it can be abused by the actors if intended.
## Vulnerability Detail
Alice and Bob don't have a good relationship.

1. Alice wants to register code and calls `registerCode`
2. Bob is an orchestrated hater and sends more gas to hijack Alice's `registerCode` call exactly with the same `_code`. 
3. Bob owns the _code and Alice doesn't.


## Impact
A targeted address might not get the code and can't be a referrer. The same can be applied to protocol addresses as well.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function registerCode(string memory _code) external {
    require(bytes(_code).length != 0, "ReferralStorage: invalid _code");
    require(
        codeOwner[_code] == address(0),
        "ReferralStorage: code already exists"
    );

    codeOwner[_code] = msg.sender;
    userCode[msg.sender] = _code;
    emit RegisterCode(msg.sender, _code);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The team might consider refactoring the `registerCode` by adding another option, which grants a randomized code by utilizing KECCAK encryption within.
