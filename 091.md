# Re-entrancy protection

## Summary
The protocol does not protect from re-entrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
```BufferBinaryOptions``` and ```BufferRouter``` import the ```ReentrancyGuard```:
```solidity
  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
```
and ```BufferBinaryOptions``` even inherits from it:
```solidity
  contract BufferBinaryOptions is
      IBufferBinaryOptions,
      ReentrancyGuard,
      ERC721,
      AccessControl
```
However, importing or inheriting is not enough, the functions have to be marked with a ```nonReentrant``` modifier to actually use it.
Both contracts fail to do so leaving the functions unprotected from this kind of attack.
What is more, the functions do not follow the **Check Effects Interactions** pattern thus leaving a gap for a potential exploit. There are many places where this could be exploited, for example, here it first transfers the tokens and only then mints the shares:
```solidity
        bool success = tokenX.transferFrom(
            account,
            address(this),
            tokenXAmount
        );
        require(success, "Pool: The Provide transfer didn't go through");

        _mint(account, mint);
```
If the token contains a transfer hook, a malicious actor can re-enter and mint more shares again before the state is updated.

Here, it first refunds the user, and only then updates the state:
```solidity
        // Refund the user in case the trade amount was lesser
        if (revisedFee < queuedTrade.totalFee) {
            tokenX.transfer(
                queuedTrade.user,
                queuedTrade.totalFee - revisedFee
            );
        }

        optionParams.totalFee = revisedFee;
        optionParams.strike = price;
        optionParams.amount = amount;

        uint256 optionId = optionsContract.createFromRouter(
            optionParams,
            isReferralValid
        );

        queuedTrade.isQueued = false;
```
A re-entrancy exploit would cause refunding multiple times and draining the contract.

When exercising the option, it first sends the funds to the user and only then burns the option:
```solidity
        profit = option.lockedAmount;
        pool.send(optionID, user, profit);

        // Burn the option
        _burn(optionID);
        option.state = State.Exercised;
```
If re-entered, the same option could be exercised again.

## Impact
If the call is intercepted by a callback hook and control is given to the user, serious harm can be caused to the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
All the critical user-facing functions should contain ```nonReentrant``` modifier and the functions should be restructured to follow the Check Effects Interactions pattern.
