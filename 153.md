# In the referral storage contract, userCode is not updated properly

## Summary

The public variable `userCode` at `ReferralStorage.sol #19` is not updated when the function `setCodeOwner` is called.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ReferralStorage` contract maintains multiple public mappings to keep track of the referral status.
There are `codeOwner` and `userCode` mappings that are supposed to provide a relationship between referral codes and the owners.
But when `codeOwner` is updated in the function `setCodeOwner` (transferring referral code to a new owner), `userCode` is not updated.

## Impact

Although the protocol does not use this variable `userCode` at the moment, I believe it is against the writer's intention and this can cause various issues on the frontend or internal usage in the future.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `userCode` as well in the `setCodeOwner` function.

```solidity
function setCodeOwner(string memory _code, address _newUser) external {
    require(bytes(_code).length != 0, "ReferralStorage: invalid _code");

    require(msg.sender == codeOwner[_code], "ReferralStorage: forbidden");

    codeOwner[_code] = _newUser;
    userCode[_newUser] = _code; //@audit update userCode as well
    emit SetCodeOwner(msg.sender, _newUser, _code);
}
```
