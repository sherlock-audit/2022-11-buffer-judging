# Too much trust outside of the contract and price bias

## Summary

The price is retrieved externally, from external APIs and passed into the contract so that decisions about the trades can be made by the project contracts at transaction time. Traders must trust a number of external entities with their money and hope there won't be malicious actors in the game.

Moreover there is a delay between price retrieval and transaction execution, which may unfairly bias trade results at execution time compared to price retrieval time.

## Vulnerability Detail
No details to add since control of price is outside of the scope and not visible.

## Impact
Traders confidence is reduced.
