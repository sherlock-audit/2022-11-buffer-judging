# Publisher signature nonce and expiration

## Summary
The publisher's signature does not include nonce and expiration parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail
Usually, the signatures should include the nonce and expiration to give a signer the flexibility to cancel the signature and re-sign or prevent it from being used again or after the deadline. Here these parameters are absent.

## Impact
The signature never expires, but this might not be a big problem in your case because the data should not change in time. However, the absence of nonce is problematic because the publisher cannot invalidate the signature in case of an error/invalid data signed. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider including the nonce in the signature and giving the ability to invalidate it (increment). Optionally consider if the signature also needs a deadline timestamp.
