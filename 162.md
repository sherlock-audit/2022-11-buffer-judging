# `tokenX.transfer` will not work as intended from some ERC20 tokens.

## Summary
When tokenX is tranferred, `tokenX.tranfer` is used. At the moment, tokenX is USDC, and transfer is okay. But other tokens can be used in the future, and transfer does not work as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `BufferBinaryOptions.sol` and `BufferRouter.sol`, the return value of transfer is not used. And in `BufferBinaryPool.sol`, the return value is used.

These two cases have problems for some ERC20 tokens.

1. return value is not used (`BufferBinaryOptions` and `BufferRouter`)
    Some ERC20 tokens return false instead of revert when transfer is failed. For those tokens, protocol can open positions without funding.
2. return value is used (`BufferBinaryPool`)
    Some ERC20 tokens don't return bool value when tranfer is successful. USDT is an example. In that case, protocol will not work.

## Impact
The `transfer` function can destroy protocol for some ERC20 tokens.

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`.
