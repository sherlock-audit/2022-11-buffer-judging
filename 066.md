# [NAZ-M1] Missing Validation In Setters

## Summary
There are some missing validation checks in some setters that could cause unwanted results.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently for `setMaxPeriod() && setMinPeriod()` they only check if the input value is `>= 1 minutes`. However, it doesn't check the value compared to the other. 

For example, `maxPeriod` could be set to less than `minPeriod` and `minPeriod` could be set to greater than `maxPeriod`.

As for `setOptionFeePerTxnLimitPercent()` has no max value to check against so it can be set to an extremely high value taking funds from the users.

## Impact
These missing checks can cause unwanted issues for the protocol.
