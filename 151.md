# `toTokenX()` breaks when `totalSupply() == 0`

## Summary
The `toTokenX()` function, used to convert `BLP` to `tokenX`, reverts when the `BLP` supply is `0`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function returns `(amount * balance) / totalSupply;`, but does not account for the case when `totalSupply == 0`. In such case, the call will revert.

## Impact
The function will not only revert before the first provider have minted `BLP`, it will also revert if at some point in the future all providers have withdrawn, making the supply `0` again.

This will affect:
- users/front ends calling the `toTokenX()` function.
- smart contracts that call `toTokenX()` to know the current `BLP to tokenX` price. This could be for instance smart contract providers that would call `toTokenX()` before calling `provide()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
return `0` if the `totalSupply()` is `0`.
