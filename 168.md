# Protocol will not work due to invalid utilization limits.

## Summary
When `assetUtilizationLimit = 0` or `overallPoolUtilizationLimit = 0`, nobody can open a new position, and the protocol will not work.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a position is opened, the option parameters are validated in `BufferBinaryOptions.checkParams`. In `checkParams`, option amount is capped by utilizable amount from `getMaxUtilization`. `getMaxUtilization` calls internal `_getMaxUtilization`. In `_getMaxUtilization`, if `utilizationLimit` = 0, `availableBalance` should be larger than `totalPoolBalance` and this is impossible. So this opening will be reverted always.

`assetUtilizationLimit` and `overallPoolUtilizationLimit` are set by admin in `OptionsConfig`, and only upper bound is used when they are set.

```solidity
require(value <= 100e2, "Utilization value too high");
```

So those utilization limits can be 0 and it will prevent opening positions.

## Impact
Nobody can open a position and the protocol will not work.

## Recommendation
Use lower bound for `assetUtilizationLimit` and `overallPoolUtilizationLimit`.
