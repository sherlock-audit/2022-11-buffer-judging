# tier in setReferrerTier can be set to out of bound, causing referrer to not receive any referrerFee

## Summary
There is no checks on tier and therefore, it can be set mistakenly to an out of bound value, causing referrer to receive 0 for referrer fees.  
## Vulnerability Detail
Tier can be set to > 3, which is not set in referralTierDiscount mapping and therefore will always return 0.

```solidity
    function setReferrerTier(address _referrer, uint8 tier)
        external
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        referrerTier[_referrer] = tier;
        emit UpdateReferrerTier(_referrer, tier);
    }
```
## Impact
Referral will receive 0 for referral fees due to admin mistakenly setting tier to an out of bound value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since number of tiers is hardcoded to 3 in `configure`, we can safely do a check of `require(tier < 3)`
