# The liquidity providers can’t keep their BLP save

## Summary
The **handler** is a  `RewardRouter` Contract (Forked from the GMX Staking contracts) which is not part of the Audit Scope as the team said. Only the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can add or remove **handlers** from `isHandler[ ]`, so you need to trust the Admin but this is not the main case 

## Vulnerability Detail
You can't just trust the **handler** to transfer **BLP** from the investors 
On `BufferBinaryPool.transferFrom()`
```solidity
        if (isHandler[msg.sender]) {
            _transfer(_sender, _recipient, _amount);
            return true;
        }
```
As we can see the **handler** can transfer any amount from/to any user

Also (The scenario is not supposed to be, but it is possible)
Lat’s say a **handler** provider supplies tokenX to the pool by invoking `BufferBinaryPool.provide()` ==> `_provide()`, so he will be registered on the `liquidityPerUser` mapping. After `lockupPeriod` he will have some `unlockedAmount`
Now the **handler** could invoke `transferFrom()` or `transfer()` directly
The `_transfer()` has an open hook  `_beforeTokenTransfer()` which is supposed to update the `liquidityPerUser` mapping and invoke `_updateLiquidity()`
```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) internal override {
        if (!isHandler[from] && !isHandler[to] && from != address(0)) {
            _updateLiquidity(from);
            require(
                liquidityPerUser[from].unlockedAmount >= value,
                "Pool: Transfer of funds in lock in period is blocked"
            );
            liquidityPerUser[from].unlockedAmount -= value;
            liquidityPerUser[to].unlockedAmount += value;
        }
    }
```
But it has a check in case the **handler** is part of this transaction from/to, it just skipped this hook and transferred the **BLP** tokens
Now both the sender and the receiver (there is some more scenario here in case the receiver transfer the tokens to another account ) can’t invoke `BufferBinaryPool.withdraw()` so the tokenX amount will be locked in the pool  

## Impact
 - The **handler** can transfer any amount of **BLP** from any user 
 - tokenX could be locked in the pool

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address _sender,
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _amount
    ) public virtual override returns (bool) {
        if (isHandler[msg.sender]) {
            _transfer(_sender, _recipient, _amount);
            return true;
        }

                liquidityPerUser[from].unlockedAmount >= value,
                "Pool: Transfer of funds in lock in period is blocked"
            );
            liquidityPerUser[from].unlockedAmount -= value;
            liquidityPerUser[to].unlockedAmount += value;
        }
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the if `_amount == allowance(_sender, msg.sender)`.Or you can add a ** time lock**.
