# The protocol won't work correctly with fee-on-transfer tokens or tokens with rebasing mechanism

## Summary
The protocol caches the `amount` value that is used in the ERC20::transfer/transferFrom calls, but if fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens are used then this will result in reverts/stuck tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC). Also some tokens may make arbitrary balance modifications outside of transfers (e.g. Ampleforth style rebasing tokens).

In most places in the code where it does a `transferFrom` from the user to the protocol itself, the value stored(cached) in storage is the `amount` argument from the `transferFrom` function. If such special tokens are used though, this will result in failures/stuck tokens down the line, when those tokens are about to be transferred out of the protocol. This happens because when you are using fee-on-transfer tokens the protocol will actually receive less value than it cached, so when it tries to transfer it it won't have enough balance. Same thing with rebasing tokens if a rebase event has happened and the protocol balance went down.

## Impact
Since the protocol docs say it should support any ERC20 token then this means protocol fails to deliver on its intentions. Also it can lead to tokens stuck in the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For fee-on-transfer tokens, cache the actual difference between the balance before the transfer and the balance after the transfer. And for rebasing tokens, add a mechanism for partial withdraw/unlock if the balance went down, and a mechanism to withdraw excess ERC20 tokens from contract if balance went up
