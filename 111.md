# A malicious early liquidity provider could prevent other users' from providing liquidity

## Summary

A malicious user could significantly prevent other users from providing liquidity to the pool by depositing a very small amount when ```totalSupply``` or ```totalTokenXBalance``` == 0 and then 'donating' a large amount of ```tokenX``` to ```BufferBinaryPool.sol```.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the ```_provide``` function in ```BufferBinaryPool.sol```, an attacker can provide 1 wei of ```tokenX``` when ```totalSupply``` or the ```totalTokenXBalance``` returns 0 so that ```totalSupply``` == 1 (since ```INITIAL_RATE``` == 1). They could then send a large amount of ```tokenX``` directly to the contract such that new depositors would need to provide large amount of tokenX to receive any shares.

## Impact

Since ```_provide``` allows a user to specify the ```minMint``` amount and does not allow mint == 0, users would not lose tokens but will be unable to mint for amounts that are too low.

## Code Snippet

[BufferBinaryPool.sol:_provide#L216-L230](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L216-L250):
```solidity
    function _provide(
        uint256 tokenXAmount,
        uint256 minMint,
        address account
    ) internal returns (uint256 mint) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        uint256 balance = totalTokenXBalance();

        require(
            balance + tokenXAmount <= maxLiquidity,
            "Pool has already reached it's max limit"
        );

        if (supply > 0 && balance > 0)
            mint = (tokenXAmount * supply) / (balance);
        else mint = tokenXAmount * INITIAL_RATE;

        require(mint >= minMint, "Pool: Mint limit is too large");
        require(mint > 0, "Pool: Amount is too small");

        bool success = tokenX.transferFrom(
            account,
            address(this),
            tokenXAmount
        );
        require(success, "Pool: The Provide transfer didn't go through");

        _mint(account, mint);

        LockedAmount memory amountLocked = LockedAmount(block.timestamp, mint);
        liquidityPerUser[account].lockedAmounts.push(amountLocked);
        _updateLiquidity(account);

        emit Provide(account, tokenXAmount, mint);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider setting a larger ```INITIAL_RATE``` value and minting an initial amount of pool tokens to the protocol to increase resistance to share manipulation.
