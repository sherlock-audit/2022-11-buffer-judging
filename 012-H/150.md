# In the router contract, nextQueueIdToProcess can be set to an arbitrary number by a malicious keeper

## Summary

The public variable `nextQueueIdToProcess` at `BufferRouter.sol #18` can be set to an arbitrary value by a malicious keeper.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `resolveQueuedTrades#184`, the protocol updates the public state variable `nextQueueIdToProcess`.
But if a malicious keeper calls with an invalid `params` (e.g. invalid signature), the for loop will keep continuing and finish without processing any queued trades.
So if the malicious keeper calls with a random `queueId` in the last element of `params`, `nextQueueIdToProcess` is set to that value.
Although the protocol does not use this value, I believe the writers intended to provide this on the front end so that the keepers can track the next queued trade.
A similar thing happens for the `userNextQueueIndexToProcess` as well.

## Impact

If these public variables are used by the front end, a malicious keeper can confuse other keepers by manipulating these values.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the protocol needs to provide valid queued trades, add an array of queued trades and use them.
