# EIP165's `supportsInterface` is not implemented correctly and code uses a vulnerable ERC165 implementation

## Summary
The `BufferBinaryOptions` does not implement the `supportsInterface` method in a proper way and also the ERC165 implementation used (from OpenZeppelin) has high and medium risk security vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability Detail
There are two issues here related to the usage of EIP165. First one is that in `BufferBinaryOptions` the `supportsInterface` smart contract does not add the `IBufferBinaryOptions` interface to the supported ones, even though it inherits from it. The second one is that the repository is using a vulnerable OpenZeppelin library version: `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2`. This version has two vulnerabilities related to ERC165Checker - [a medium one](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-7grf-83vw-6f5x) and [a high one](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-qh9x-gcfh-pcrw). Even though those currently should not pose a threat in the repository it is unsafe to depend on the vulnerable code.

## Impact
The problem is that EIP165 is not implemented correctly and also a vulnerable version of OpenZeppelin related to EIP165 is used.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);` to 
```solidity
return interfaceId == type(IBufferBinaryOptions).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
```
And upgrade OpenZeppelin dependency to latest version.
