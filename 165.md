# Opening position can be reverted due to lack of referrer fee

## Summary
When a position is opened, referrer fee is paid from settlement fee. But settlement fee can be less than referrer fee. In that case, the option can not be opened.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    uint256 settlementFee = optionParams.totalFee -
        option.premium -
        referrerFee;
```

totalFee - premium is settlement fee from `BufferBinaryOptions.checkParams`. So if `referrerFee` is larger than `revisedFee` of `checkParams`, `BufferBinaryOptions.createFromRouter` will be reverted due to underflow. So the position will not be opened.
In `checkParams`, the `revisedFee` is from settlement fee percentage, and this percentage is calculated in `_getSettlementFeePercentage` as follows.

`
settlementFeePercentage = baseSettlementFeePercentage - stepSize * maxStep
`

`maxStep` is from `_getSettlementFeeDiscount`, and `ReferralStorage._referrerTierStep` can be used for this `maxStep`.

`_referrerTierStep` is set by admin in `ReferralStorage.configure`, but there is no limitation. So `settlementFeePercentage` can be less than `stepSize`, and `stepSize` less than `referrerFee`.


## Impact
`createFromRouter` will be reverted, and option will not be opened.
