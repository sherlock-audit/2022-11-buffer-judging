# settlementFee and premium should be validated

## Summary
For premium value calculation it must be validated. Also settlementFee too. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no validation for fee calculations. Amount always sent multiplied by token decimals but there may be a token without decimals. Which makes total fee 0. premium variable has uint256 type and if amount is odd or even 1 it  makes it 0. 

## Impact
Fees can be 0.
