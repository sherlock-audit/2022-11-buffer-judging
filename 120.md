# transfer return value not checked

## Summary

According to the "On-chain context" description, any ERC20 should be supported. 

> DEPLOYMENT: arbitrum
> ERC20: any
> ERC721: none
> ADMIN: trusted

But some ERC20 does not fully comply with the standard, such as USDT. The transferFrom doesnâ€™t revert upon failure but returns false.

Even USDC could change, since it is upgradable. Deviate from the ERC20 standard is one possibility.


## Vulnerability Detail

The following fee transfer return value is not checked and could potentially incur fund loss: 
- `settlementFee`
- `referrerFee`
- `totalFee`
- `totalFee` refund (`queuedTrade.totalFee - revisedFee`)
- `revisedFee`


## Impact

Some fee could not be received and lost, the protocol and users both could be affected
