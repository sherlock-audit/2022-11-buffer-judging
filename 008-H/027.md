# First liquidity provider to BufferBinaryPool can block users with low funds from depositing their tokens

## Summary
This is a common problem with vault-like contracts. Whenever someone deposits token X to receive newly minted shares Y, the first caller can manipulate the vault. In this case, the first caller is able to block anybody with fewer funds than them from providing liquidity to the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. You deposit 1 token to get 1 share
2. You send a very large number of tokens, $Z$ directly to the pool
3. Subsequent liquidity providers have to deposit more than $Z$ tokens because of the way shares are calculated:
$shares = amount * supply / balance$ Since $supply = 1$ and $balance = Z$, $amount$ has to be $>= balance$ for $shares$ to be $>0$. 

The pool already blocks deposit calls where no shares are minted. Thus, you're not able to steal other people's liquidity. But, you can still stop them from depositing unless they use a very large number of funds. Since the first liquidity provider is able to withdraw their tokens at some point in the future, the attacker only has the opportunity cost to worry about.

The actual amount needed to block a large number of users depends on the popularity of the protocol. 

## Impact
Liquidity providers with a small amount of liquidity won't be able to deposit their tokens.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-buffer/blob/main/contracts/contracts/core/BufferBinaryPool.sol#L216-L250

```sol
    function _provide(
        uint256 tokenXAmount,
        uint256 minMint,
        address account
    ) internal returns (uint256 mint) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        uint256 balance = totalTokenXBalance();

        require(
            balance + tokenXAmount <= maxLiquidity,
            "Pool has already reached it's max limit"
        );

        if (supply > 0 && balance > 0)
            mint = (tokenXAmount * supply) / (balance);
        else mint = tokenXAmount * INITIAL_RATE;

        require(mint >= minMint, "Pool: Mint limit is too large");
        require(mint > 0, "Pool: Amount is too small");

        bool success = tokenX.transferFrom(
            account,
            address(this),
            tokenXAmount
        );
        require(success, "Pool: The Provide transfer didn't go through");

        _mint(account, mint);

        LockedAmount memory amountLocked = LockedAmount(block.timestamp, mint);
        liquidityPerUser[account].lockedAmounts.push(amountLocked);
        _updateLiquidity(account);

        emit Provide(account, tokenXAmount, mint);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Uniswap had the same issue with their V2 contracts. They solved it by sending the first 1000 shares to the zero address: https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L121
