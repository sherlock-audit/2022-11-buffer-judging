# First `BufferBinaryPool` provider can inflate the `BLP` price

## Summary
The first `provider` of a `BufferBinaryPool` can break the `BLP` token price for future providers.


## Vulnerability Detail
The function `provide()` allows a provider to receive BLP tokens, in exchange for `tokenX`.

The amount of `BLP` minted to the caller is computed by multiplying the `amount` of `tokenX` supplied with the `BLP` supply, and dividing it by the `tokenX` balance of the pool.

```solidity
mint = (tokenXAmount * supply) / (balance);
```

The first provider can inflate the `BLP` price:

- The first provider calls `provide()` by supplying `tokenXAmount = 1 wei`. They receive `1 BLP`.
- Then, they transfer a large amount of `tokenX` to the pool using the `ERC20.transfer()` method - say `1e10`, taking `USDC` as the example here.
- Another provider calls `provide()`, supplying `tokenXAmount = 2e10`. Because of the mint calculation: `mint = (2e10 * 1) / (1e10 + 1) = 1`, they receive only `1 BLP`.
- The first provider can now call `withdraw()`, the amount computed will be `(balanceOf(account) * balance) / 
     totalSupply = 1 * (3e10 + 1) / 2 = 1.5e10`.

The first provider effectively stole `1.5e10` from the second provider.

## Recommendation
Consider sending the first `BLP` tokens to the address zero, a mitigation done on [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124).
