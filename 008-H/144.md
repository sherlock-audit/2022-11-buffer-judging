# The attacker can manipulate the pricePerShare in `BufferBinaryPool.sol`.

## Summary
The attacker can manipulate the pricePerShare in `BufferBinaryPool.sol`.

By manipulating and inflating the pricePerShare between `tokenX` and `BLP` to a high value, all future depositors might lose a significant part of their deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is a well-known issue of the first depositor and the below scenario would be possible.

- Attacker calls `provide()` with 1 wei of `tokenX` and get `1 * INITIAL_RATE` shares.
- After that, the attacker transfers `INITIAL_RATE * 1e18 - 1` wei of `tokenX` to the pool directly and inflates the price per share from `1 / INITIAL_RATE` to `1e18`.
- Then if the future user calls `provide()` with `1.5e18` wei of `tokenX`, he will get only 1 share and lose `0.5e18` wei of `tokenX`.

## Impact
Users might lose a significant part of their funds while calling `provide()`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send part of the initial mints as a permanent reserve somewhere so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.
