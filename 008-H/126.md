# A malicious early user/attacker can manipulate the LP Token's pricePerShare to take an unfair share of future users' provide

## Summary
A well known attack vector for almost all shares based liquidity pool contracts, where an early user can manipulate the price per share and profit from late users' provide because of the precision loss caused by the rather large value of price per share.
## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious early user can provide() with 1 wei of tokenX as the first provider of the LP Token, and get 1 wei of shares.

Then the attacker can send 10000e18 - 1 of tokenX and inflate the price per share from 1.0000 to an extreme value of 1.0000e22 ( from (1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1) .

As a result, the future user who provides 19999e18 will only receive 1 wei (from 19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18) of shares token.

They will lose 9999e18 or half of their provide if they withdraw() .
## Impact
The attacker can profit from future users' provide. While the late users will lose part of their funds to the attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first provider, and send a part of the initial mints as a reserve to the DAO so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.
